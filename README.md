# k8s:fwd â€” config-based kubernetes multi-port forwarding

A tool for handling port-forwards to multiple services and across multiple clusters.

To install the latest version, run:

```shell
cargo install k8sfwd
```

Please note that the application internally relies on `kubectl`, so it needs to be present in your path.
If `kubectl` is not on your path, you may specify it via the `--kubectl` argument or
the `KUBECTL_PATH` environment variable.

## Configuration

If no configuration file is specified when starting the application, it will recursively look for
a `.k8sfwd` file in the current directory hierarchy. If a file is specified on program launch,
this configuration is used instead.

```yaml
